This is an excellent project idea, and it will help you learn a lot about system design, file handling, and configuration management in Rust. Below, I'll guide you through the process of designing and implementing this project step by step, focusing on how to achieve modularity, customization, and proper file organization.

---

### **1. Project Design Overview**
The program will:
- Accept a command (e.g., `goto`) and a project name as input.
- Read configuration files to determine what actions to perform for each project.
- Allow users to customize:
  - The command name (`goto` can be changed to something else).
  - The project-specific commands (e.g., `git fetch origin`, `docker-compose up`, etc.).

### **2. File Organization**
In Arch Linux, you can organize your project files as follows:

#### **a. Executable Binary**
- Place the compiled Rust binary in `/usr/local/bin/` or `/usr/bin/` so that it is accessible system-wide.
- Example: `/usr/local/bin/goto`

#### **b. Configuration Files**
- Store configuration files in `/etc/goto/` or `$HOME/.config/goto/` depending on whether you want system-wide or user-specific configurations.
- Example:
  - `/etc/goto/config.toml` (system-wide)
  - `$HOME/.config/goto/config.toml` (user-specific)

#### **c. Project-Specific Commands**
- Store project-specific commands in separate files under a directory like `/etc/goto/projects/` or `$HOME/.config/goto/projects/`.
- Example:
  - `/etc/goto/projects/fursure.toml`
  - `/etc/goto/projects/another_project.toml`

#### **d. Logs (Optional)**
- If you want to log the program's activity, create a log directory:
  - `/var/log/goto/` (system-wide)
  - `$HOME/.local/share/goto/logs/` (user-specific)

---

### **3. Configuration File Structure**
Use a structured format like TOML for configuration files. Here's how they might look:

#### **a. Main Configuration File (`config.toml`)**
This file defines global settings, such as the command name and default behavior.

```toml
# /etc/goto/config.toml or $HOME/.config/goto/config.toml

command_name = "goto"  # Changeable command name
default_project = "fursure"  # Default project if none is specified
log_enabled = true  # Enable logging
log_directory = "/var/log/goto/"  # Log directory
```

#### **b. Project-Specific Configuration File (`fursure.toml`)**
Each project has its own configuration file defining the commands to run.

```toml
# /etc/goto/projects/fursure.toml or $HOME/.config/goto/projects/fursure.toml

directory = "/path/to/fursure/project"
commands = [
    "git fetch origin",
    "code .",  # Opens VS Code
    "docker-compose up -d"
]
```

---

### **4. Program Workflow**
Here’s how the program should work:

#### **Step 1: Parse Input**
- The program reads the command-line arguments (e.g., `goto fursure`).
- It extracts the project name (`fursure`) and looks for its configuration file.

#### **Step 2: Load Configuration**
- The program reads the main configuration file (`config.toml`) to determine the command name and other global settings.
- It then loads the project-specific configuration file (e.g., `fursure.toml`) to get the list of commands.

#### **Step 3: Execute Commands**
- For each command in the project-specific configuration file:
  - Change to the specified directory (`cd`).
  - Execute the command using Rust's `std::process::Command`.

#### **Step 4: Handle Errors**
- If a project-specific configuration file is missing or a command fails, display an error message and optionally log the issue.

---

### **5. Customization**
To make the program highly customizable:

#### **a. Changeable Command Name**
- The `command_name` field in `config.toml` determines the command name.
- When installing the binary, create a symbolic link with the desired name:
  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/goto /usr/local/bin/mycustomcommand
  ```
- Update the `command_name` field in `config.toml` to match the new name.

#### **b. User-Defined Commands**
- Users can edit the project-specific `.toml` files to define their own commands.
- For example, one user might use `code .` to open VS Code, while another might use `vim .` to open Vim.

#### **c. Default Project**
- The `default_project` field in `config.toml` allows users to specify a default project to use when no project name is provided.

---

### **6. Implementation Steps**
Here’s how you would implement this step by step:

#### **Step 1: Create the Binary**
- Write a Rust program that parses command-line arguments and reads TOML files.
- Use the `clap` crate for argument parsing and the `toml` crate for reading TOML files.

#### **Step 2: Install the Binary**
- Compile the Rust program and place the binary in `/usr/local/bin/` or `/usr/bin/`.
- Optionally, create a symbolic link for the desired command name.

#### **Step 3: Set Up Configuration Files**
- Create the necessary directories (`/etc/goto/` or `$HOME/.config/goto/`).
- Add a sample `config.toml` and a few project-specific `.toml` files.

#### **Step 4: Test the Program**
- Run the program with different project names and verify that it executes the correct commands.
- Test error handling by providing invalid project names or missing configuration files.

### **7. Additional Features**
Once the basic functionality is working, you can add more features:
- **Interactive Mode**: Allow users to select a project interactively if no project name is provided.
- **Logging**: Log all executed commands and their output to a file.
- **Environment Variables**: Support environment variables in commands (e.g., `$PROJECT_DIR`).
- **Shell Integration**: Add shell autocompletion for project names.

---

### **8. Summary**
- **Binary Location**: `/usr/local/bin/goto`
- **Configuration Files**:
  - Global: `/etc/goto/config.toml` or `$HOME/.config/goto/config.toml`
  - Projects: `/etc/goto/projects/*.toml` or `$HOME/.config/goto/projects/*.toml`
- **Logs**: `/var/log/goto/` or `$HOME/.local/share/goto/logs/`
- **Customization**: Use `config.toml` to change the command name and default project.

By following this design, you’ll have a modular, customizable, and maintainable program that simplifies your development workflow. Let me know if you need further clarification!
